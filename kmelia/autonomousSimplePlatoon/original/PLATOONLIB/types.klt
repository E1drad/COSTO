# primitive types for kmelia  (sets and arrays are hard coded)
# KMLTYPE optional @ java class which should later in the refinement 
# provide an instance static field for the root primitive type 
# a factory method for complex types #(under refactoring)
# then standard type definition. if name = type then it's a primitive type
